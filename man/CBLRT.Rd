\title{Likelihood Ratio Test for Complete Bipartite (CB) Ordered Alternatives}
\usage{
CBLRT(sample_data, significance_level, k0, n.boot = 1e+05, seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{sample_data}{A list of numeric vectors, where the first \code{k0} elements
represent control groups and the remaining elements represent treatment groups.}

\item{significance_level}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 specifying the
significance level for the test (e.g., \code{0.05}).}

\item{k0}{An integer specifying the number of control groups.}

\item{n.boot}{Number of bootstrap replications to estimate the critical value
(default is \code{100000}).}

\item{seed}{Optional random seed for reproducibility.}
}
\value{
A character string summarizing the results, including the critical value,
CBLRT test statistic, estimated p-value, and the test decision.
}
\description{
Performs a likelihood ratio test (LRT) to evaluate the equality of means
across multiple groups under the Complete Bipartite (CB) ordered alternatives.
The test compares the null hypothesis of equal means for all groups
to the alternative that the control group means are less than or equal
to the treatment group means under the CB order restriction.
}
\details{
The likelihood ratio statistic is computed using constrained
maximum likelihood estimates under the null and CB ordered alternative hypotheses.
The critical value and p-value are estimated by a bootstrap procedure.
The test evaluates the hypotheses H_0: μ_i = μ_j versus H_1: μ_i ≤ μ_j (at least one strict inequality)
for i = 1, ..., k0 (control groups) and j = k0 + 1, ..., p (total treatment groups).

\examples{
# Generate sample data
set.seed(456)
control1 <- rnorm(20, mean = 5)
control2 <- rnorm(20, mean = 5)
treatment1 <- rnorm(20, mean = 6)
treatment2 <- rnorm(20, mean = 7)

data_list <- list(control1, control2, treatment1, treatment2)

# Run CB LRT with fewer bootstrap replications for demonstration
CBLRT(data_list, 0.05, k0 = 2, n.boot = 1000)

\donttest{
# Recommended: Use 100000 for research-level accuracy
CBLRT(data_list, 0.05, k0 = 2, n.boot = 100000)

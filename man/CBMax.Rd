\title{Maximum Difference-based Test for Complete Bipartite (CB) Ordered Alternatives}
\usage{
CBMax(sample_data, significance_level, k0, n.boot = 1e+05, seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{sample_data}{A list of numeric vectors, where the first \code{k0} elements
correspond to the control groups and the remaining elements correspond to the
treatment groups.}

\item{significance_level}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 specifying the
significance level of the test (e.g., \code{0.05}).}

\item{k0}{An integer specifying the number of control groups.}

\item{n.boot}{Number of bootstrap replications used to estimate the critical value
(default is \code{100000}).}

\item{seed}{Optional random seed for reproducibility.}
}
\value{
A character string summarizing the results, including the critical value,
the CBMax test statistic, the estimated p-value, and the test decision.
}
\description{
Performs a Maximum Difference-based (CBMax) test to evaluate the equality of group means
under the Complete Bipartite (CB) order restriction. This test compares the null
hypothesis of equal means across all groups against the alternative that the means
of the control groups are less than or equal to those of the treatment groups.
}
\details{
The test statistic is computed as the maximum standardized difference
between each treatment group mean and each control group mean under the CB order restriction.
The critical value and p-value are estimated via bootstrap resampling from the null distribution.
The test evaluates the hypotheses H_0: μ_i = μ_j versus H_1: μ_i ≤ μ_j (at least one strict inequality)
for i = 1, ..., k0 (control groups) and j = k0 + 1, ..., p (total treatment groups).
}
\examples{
# Generate sample data
set.seed(456)
control1 <- rnorm(20, mean = 5)
control2 <- rnorm(20, mean = 5)
treatment1 <- rnorm(20, mean = 6)
treatment2 <- rnorm(20, mean = 7)
data_list <- list(control1, control2, treatment1, treatment2)

# Run CBMax test with fewer bootstrap samples for demonstration
CBMax(sample_data = data_list, significance_level = 0.05, k0 = 2, n.boot = 1000)

\donttest{
# Recommended: use 100000 bootstrap samples for higher precision
CBMax(sample_data = data_list, significance_level = 0.05, k0 = 2, n.boot = 100000)
}
